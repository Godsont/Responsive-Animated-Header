# Responsive-Animated-Header

This is a Responsive Animated Header where in the desktop version we have two different versions of the header.

When the user scrolls down 300px we get to see the second versoin of the desktop header.

Then we also have a mobile header.

Take a look at the demo: https://godsont.github.io/Responsive-Animated-Header/
